<h1>Stock-Simulator by Sarveshwar Senthil Kumar</h1>
<h3>Stock-Simulator, as the name suggests, is a web-based stock simulator which allows users to login and practice their trading strategies as well as compete with friends. Every user starts with 25,000$ and is encouraged to try to make as much money as possible. This project is a webapp created using the Flask module in Python for the backend as well as basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. In terms of the inner workings, trades and authentication information is stored on SQLite3 servers but could easily be migrated to MySQL. The real time trading data is provided courtesy of the yFinance module in Python.</h3>
